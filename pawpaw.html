    <h1><u>pawpaw</u></h1>
    <p>Pawpaw (Carica papaya L.) is a popular tropical American fruit. It is commonly cultivated for its small to large melon-like fruit.

        The type of inflorescence produced by papaya trees reflects whether the tree is male, female, or hermaphrodite. Male trees have many flowers on long, pendulous panicles, whereas female trees have solitary flowers or clusters of a few yellow-green flowers.
        
        The papaya fruit is a large fleshy berry with smooth green skin that turns yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit's flesh is thick and succulent, ranging in color from yellow to red or orange. Many black wrinkled seeds are present in the fruit. 
        
        Papaya trees can live for up to 25 years and grow to a height of 2-10 m (6.6-33 ft). To ensure maximum productivity, plantations are typically replaced every three years. 
        
        Papaya, also known as pawpaw, is thought to have originated in the Caribbean region of Central America.
